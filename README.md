This is a home assignment built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Key Features

1. TypeScript: The app is fully typed using TypeScript to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
2. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application, enabling rapid UI development with utility-first classes.
3. Mesh Gradient UI: A visually appealing mesh gradient technique is implemented to give the app a modern and dynamic look.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
